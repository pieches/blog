[00:14.23]For twenty-seven years I've been trying to believe and confide in
[00:22.96]Different people I've found
[00:29.74]Some of them got closer than others
[00:34.48]Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
[00:45.08]I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
[00:53.40]But I was happy to explain
[01:00.17]I never really knew how to move you
[01:04.67]So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins and I saw you
[01:16.51]But that's not an invitation, that's all I get
[01:23.94]If this is communication I disconnect
[01:31.67]I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
[01:49.71]You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
[01:58.38]In the corner of your eye
[02:04.95]I'll never really learn how to love you
[02:09.40]But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky where I see you
[02:21.20]And that's not an invitation, that's all I get
[02:28.74]If this is communication I disconnect
[02:36.11]I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect, so I disconnect
[03:18.12]Well this is an invitation, it's not a threat
[03:25.13]If you want communication that's what you get
[03:33.85]I'm talking and talking but I don't know how to connect
[03:41.08]And I hold a record for being patient with your kind of hesitation
[03:57.25]I need you, you want me but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
[04:02.80]I disconnect
